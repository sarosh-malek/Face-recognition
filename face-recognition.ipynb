    "## Deep face recognition with Keras, Dlib and OpenCV\n",
    "\n",
    "Face recognition identifies persons on face images or video frames. In a nutshell, a face recognition system extracts features from an input face image and compares them to the features of labeled faces in a database. Comparison is based on a feature similarity metric and the label of the most similar database entry is used to label the input image. If the similarity value is below a certain threshold the input image is labeled as *unknown*. Comparing two face images to determine if they show the same person is known as face verification.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook uses a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) to extract features from input images. It follows the approach described in [[1]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1503.03832) with modifications inspired by the [OpenFace](http://cmusatyalab.github.io/openface/) project. [Keras](https://keras.io/) is used for implementing the CNN, [Dlib](http://dlib.net/) and [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/) for aligning faces on input images. Face recognition performance is evaluated on a small subset of the [LFW](http://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/lfw/) dataset which you can replace with your own custom dataset e.g. with images of your family and friends if you want to further experiment with this notebook. After an overview of the CNN architecure and how the model can be trained, it is demonstrated how to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Detect, transform, and crop faces on input images. This ensures that faces are aligned before feeding them into the CNN. This preprocessing step is very important for the performance of the neural network.\n",
    "- Use the CNN to extract 128-dimensional representations, or *embeddings*, of faces from the aligned input images. In embedding space, Euclidean distance directly corresponds to a measure of face similarity. \n",
    "- Compare input embedding vectors to labeled embedding vectors in a database. Here, a support vector machine (SVM) and a KNN classifier, trained on labeled embedding vectors, play the role of a database. Face recognition in this context means using these classifiers to predict the labels i.e. identities of new inputs.\n",

    "### Environment setup\n",

    "For running this notebook, create and activate a new [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html) and install the packages listed in [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) with `pip install -r requirements.txt`. Furthermore, you'll need a local copy of Dlib's face landmarks data file for running face alignment:"

    "The CNN architecture used here is a variant of the inception architecture [[2]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.4842). More precisely, it is a variant of the NN4 architecture described in [[1]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1503.03832) and identified as [nn4.small2](https://cmusatyalab.github.io/openface/models-and-accuracies/#model-definitions) model in the OpenFace project. This notebook uses a Keras implementation of that model whose definition was taken from the [Keras-OpenFace](https://github.com/iwantooxxoox/Keras-OpenFace) project. The architecture details aren't too important here, it's only useful to know that there is a fully connected layer with 128 hidden units followed by an L2 normalization layer on top of the convolutional base. These two top layers are referred to as the *embedding layer* from which the 128-dimensional embedding vectors can be obtained. The complete model is defined in [model.py](model.py) and a graphical overview is given in [model.png](model.png). A Keras version of the nn4.small2 model can be created with `create_model()`."

    "Given an estimate of the distance threshold $\\tau$, face recognition is now as simple as calculating the distances between an input embedding vector and all embedding vectors in a database. The input is assigned the label (i.e. identity) of the database entry with the smallest distance if it is less than $\\tau$ or label *unknown* otherwise. This procedure can also scale to large databases as it can be easily parallelized. It also supports one-shot learning, as adding only a single entry of a new identity might be sufficient to recognize new examples of that identity.\n",
    "\n",
    "A more robust approach is to label the input using the top $k$ scoring entries in the database which is essentially [KNN classification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-nearest_neighbors_algorithm) with a Euclidean distance metric. Alternatively, a linear [support vector machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Support_vector_machine) (SVM) can be trained with the database entries and used to classify i.e. identify new inputs. For training these classifiers we use 50% of the dataset, for evaluation the other 50%."
